  Envbuilder Provider
  The Envbuilder provider can be used to check for the presence of a Docker image previously built by Envbuilder https://github.com/coder/envbuilder.
  This allows re-using a previously built image pushed to a Docker registry without having to rebuild it.
  An image built by Envbuilder also embeds the Envbuilder binary inside the image, allowing for the image to be used to build other images.

# Envbuilder Provider

The Envbuilder provider can be used to check for the presence of a Docker image previously built by [Envbuilder](https://github.com/coder/envbuilder).
This allows re-using a previously built image pushed to a Docker registry without having to rebuild it.
An image built by Envbuilder also embeds the Envbuilder binary inside the image, allowing for the image to be used to build other images.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    envbuilder = {
      source = "coder/envbuilder"
    }
  }
}

// The provider currently requires no additional configuration.
provider "envbuilder" {}
```
