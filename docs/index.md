# Envbuilder Provider

The Envbuilder provider can be used to check for the presence of a container image previously built by [Envbuilder](https://github.com/coder/envbuilder).
This allows re-using a previously built image pushed to a container registry without having to rebuild it.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    envbuilder = {
      source = "coder/envbuilder"
    }
  }
}

// The provider currently requires no additional configuration.
provider "envbuilder" {}
```
